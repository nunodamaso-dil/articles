# Catamorphisms, folds, reducers, aggregates - why should you care?

## Intro  

What the #$%&/!" Nuno?! Stick with me, what follows is superman stuff.  

Although Catamorphisms represent a broader, more abstract concept than folds, reduces or aggregates, the underlying principle is the same:

We have a list with 5 numbers: [5,2,6,2,7]

- Whats the sum of them all?

- Whats the product of them all?

- Whats the concatenation of them all?

Whenever you collapse the items in a list into something else, you are *folding/reducing* these items into a new thing. Here **the output are primitive types**, int(sum, product) or string (concatenation), but it can be anything.  

- What are the even numbers? And the odds?

If you were to *filter* the list by the even numbers, this filter operation itself is a reducer. **The output is a new list** with a different arity.

- Return an object with two properties: Odd and Even. Each property's value is the corresponding sum.  

Now things get trickier. Sure, we can filter twice the list. Then sum both of them and assign the result to a given object. But you can actually, through the power of catamorphisms, convert an array into this object in one go - **the output this time will be an object**.  
  
In mathematics, this is represented by (FILL IN). The inverse process, of expanding, is called an Anamorphism.  

There are of course, embeded functions on every programming language/framework to help out with the basics - a sum, a string join, a filter, or even a combination of those can get the job done for the above examples and you can find them in Outsystems, c# or javascript.  

For a fold/reduce/aggregate, you can find them in javascript or c#, used by Outsystems - this is what we will be looking at and how it can help you out every day.

## An every-day example

Here's a real world scenario, we have the following response from an API integration:  

~~~json
[
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 1,
        "value": "Address"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 2,
        "value": "Name"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 3,
        "value": "City"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 4,
        "value": "Country"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "1",
        "value": "Street 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "2",
        "value": "Name 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "3",
        "value": "City 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "4",
        "value": "Country 1"
    },
        {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "1",
        "value": "Street 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "2",
        "value": "Name 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "3",
        "value": "City 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "4",
        "value": "Country 2"
    },
]
~~~

I know what you're thinking, this looks like SHIT!  
Right.

We'd like the following output:  

~~~json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "Address": "Address 1",
        "Name": "Name 1",
        "City": "City 1",
        "Country": "Country 1"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "Address": "Address 2",
        "Name": "Name 2",
        "City": "City 2",
        "Country": "Country 2"
    }
]
~~~

Here's what we're gonna do, we're going to *fold*/*reduce*/*agregate* our input array of different objects into a new one. Here's how in javascript:

JS

~~~javascript
let columnMap = {}
let rowMap = {}
input.reduce((outputArray, nextItem) => {
    if (nextItem.key === "columnName"){
        columnMap[nextItem.columnId] = nextItem.value
    }else if (nextItem.key === "row"){
        rowMap[id] = 
        
    }
}, {})
~~~  

C#

~~~c#
input.aggregate
~~~
