# Catamorphisms, folds, reducers, aggregates - why should you care?

## Intro  

If you're thinking "what the #$%&/!" Nuno?!", then stick with me, what follows is superman stuff.

Although Catamorphisms (catas) represent a broader, more abstract concept than folds, reduces or aggregates, the underlying principle is the same:

Say we have a list with 5 numbers: [5,2,6,2,7]

- Whats the sum of them all? 5+2+6+2+7=22

- Whats the product of them all? 5*2*6*2*7=840

- Whats the concatenation of them all? "52627"

- Whats the distinct list?

Whenever you collapse the items in a list into something else, you are *folding/reducing* these items into a new thing. Here **the output are primitive types**, int(sum, product, distinct) or string(concatenation), but it can be anything, even an object or a structure.  

The inverse process, of expanding, is called an Anamorphism.  

There are of course, embeded functions on every programming language/framework to help out with the basics - a sum, a string join, a filter, or even a combination of those can get the job done for the above examples and you can find them in Outsystems, c# or javascript.  

For a fold/reduce/aggregate, you can find them in javascript or c#, used by Outsystems - this is what we will be looking at and how it can help you out every day.

## An every-day example

Here's a real world scenario, we have the following response from an API integration:  

~~~json
[
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 1,
        "value": "Address"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 2,
        "value": "Name"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 3,
        "value": "City"
    },
    {
        "key": "columnName",
        "columnId": 4,
        "value": "Country"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "1",
        "value": "Street 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "2",
        "value": "Name 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "3",
        "value": "City 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 1,
        "columnId": "4",
        "value": "Country 1"
    },
        {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "1",
        "value": "Street 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "2",
        "value": "Name 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "3",
        "value": "City 2"
    },
    {
        "key": "row",
        "id": 2,
        "columnId": "4",
        "value": "Country 2"
    },
]
~~~

I know what you're thinking, this looks like SHIT!  
Right.

We'd like the following output:  

~~~json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "Address": "Address 1",
        "Name": "Name 1",
        "City": "City 1",
        "Country": "Country 1"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "Address": "Address 2",
        "Name": "Name 2",
        "City": "City 2",
        "Country": "Country 2"
    }
]
~~~

Here's what we're gonna do, we're going to *fold*/*reduce*/*agregate* our input array of different objects into a new one. Here's how in javascript:

JS

~~~javascript
let columnMap = {}
let rowMap = {}
input.reduce((outputArray, nextItem) => {
    nextItem.key === "columnName" ? (columnMap[nextItem.columnId] = nextItem.value) : (rowMap[id] = )
}, {})
~~~  

C#

~~~c#
input.aggregate
~~~
